  description: |
    This resource describes the sensed or the definable properties associated with altimeter.
    The resource can be readonly (oic.if.s interface) in which instance it represents a sensor.
    The resource can be readwrite (oic.if.rw interface) in which instance it represents not sensor and updatable.
    altitude is height of the position (metres) from as defined by the altitudereference property.
    altitudereference is the reference datum point that altitude is being mesured from. The default will be sea-level.
